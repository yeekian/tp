# Developer Guide

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by the authors' experiences using the Canvas learning management system. 

While Canvas serves large educational environments well, they envisioned a simpler, offline tool tailored for small classes that prioritizes essential features like grade tracking, student management, and assessment organization. Thus, TutorLink was born.
## Design & implementation

### Architecture

The high-level design of TutorLink is as depicted in the following **Architecture Diagram**:

![Architecture.png](diagrams/Architecture.png)

**Main Components of the Architecture**

<code>TutorLink</code>: Main class that serves as the main entry point of the application.

- At app launch, TutorLink initializes components (<code>Parser</code>, <code>Ui</code>, <code>Storage</code>, <code>
  AppState</code>).
- On app shutdown, it shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods.

The key classes providing functionality to TutorLink are:

1. <code>AppState</code>: Stores global variables/resources required by TutorLink at run time.
2. <code>Ui</code>: Collects data (via Strings sent via CLI) from the user and relays information to the user (via
   printing back to the CLI).
3. <code>Parser</code>: Interprets the raw data from the user; applies data validation and handles necessary exceptions.
4. <code>Storage</code>: Handles the loading and storage of data to be retained even after TutorLink is shut down.
5. <code>CommandResult</code>: Represents the result of user input.

## Implementation

### Command execution sequence: 

All commands follow the sequence as described in the diagram below: 

![ArchitectureSequenceGrouped.png](diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceGrouped.png)

Where <code>ref</code> frame is a placeholder for each command's specific operations.

#### Setup:

During the setup phase of `TutorLink`, the following operations are performed:
1. `StudentStorage`, `ComponentStorage` and `GradeStorage` objects are instantiated
2. `ArrayList` of Student, Component and Grade are obtained from the respective Storage classes
3. `AppState` object is instantiated, passing the `ArrayList`s in step 3
4. `Ui` displays welcome message

![Setup.png](diagrams/Setup.png)

The specific implementation of noteworthy operations are presented below: 

### Add/Delete Student/Component Feature

#### Implementation Details
The `AddStudentCommand`, `DeleteStudentCommand`, `AddComponentCommand` and `DeleteComponentCommand` handles the addition and deletion of `Student` and `Component` within the TutorLink application, respectively.
Each command validates user input to ensure accuracy and consistency before making changes, preserving data integrity. Students are stored as `Student` objects within a `StudentList`. Components are stored as `Component` objects within a `ComponentList`.

#### Key Operations

The flow of logic for both `Student` and `Component` commands can be summarized as follows: 

- `AddStudentCommand.execute(AppState appState, HashMap<String, String> arguments)`: Adds a student to the application by
  performing the following steps:

    1. Retrieves and validates the matriculation number and name from `arguments`, throwing relevant exception in the case
       of failure.
    2. Creates and adds a `Student` object to `StudentList` in `AppState`
    3. Return `CommandResult` that contains the result of the Add/Delete operation.

The following sequence diagrams depict the exact steps involved in the `AddStudentCommand`:

![AddStudentCommand.png](diagrams/AddStudentCommand.png)

- `DeleteStudentCommand.execute(AppState appState, HashMap<String, String> arguments)`: Removes a student via the following
  steps:
    1. Retrieves and validates the matriculation number from arguments, throwing `IllegaValueException` exception
       if matriculation number is null.
    2. Searches for and deletes the student from `AppState`. Throws `StudentNotFoundException` if no student matching the matriculation number
       is found.
    3. Searches for and deletes `Grade` objects in `GradeList` containing a student matching the matriculation number.

![DeleteStudentCommand.png](diagrams/DeleteStudentCommand.png)

*Note: Step (iii) is performed because a `Grade` object is only well-defined when there are both `Student` and `Component` objects to be refrenced by `Grade`,
whenever a `Student` or `Component` object is deleted, the corresponding `Grade` object is queried and then deleted as well.*

The logic for `AddComponentCommand` is very similar (replacing `matriculation number` with `component description`and is therefore not depicted.
 
### Find Student Feature

#### Implementation Details
The `FindStudentCommand` searches for and returns matching `Students` stored in the TutorLink application. 
`FindStudentCommand` can accept either `matric number` or `name` as argument. If `matric number` is supplied, the query 
will be executed using `matric number`, else `name` will be used for the search query. 

#### Key Operations

The flow of logic for `FindStudentCommand` can be summarized as follows:

- `FindStudentCommand.execute(AppState appState, HashMap<String, String> arguments)`: Adds a student to the application by
  performing the following steps:

    1. Retrieves and validates the matriculation number/name from `arguments`, throwing relevant exception in the case
       of failure.
    2. Calls `AppState.findStudentByMatricNumber` and `AppState.findStudentByName` respectively to fetch list of `Student` 
objects matching the supplied `matric number`/`name`.
    3. Return `CommandResult` that contains the matching `Students`.

The following sequence diagrams depict the exact steps involved in the `FindStudentCommand`:
![FindStudentCommand.png](diagrams/FindStudentCommand.png)

### Add/Delete Grade Feature

#### Implementation Details

The `AddGradeCommand` and `DeleteGradeCommand` classes handle the addition and deletion of grades for students within the TutorLink application. Each command validates user input to ensure accuracy and consistency before making changes, preserving data integrity. Grades are stored as `Grade` objects within a `GradeList`.

#### Key Operations

- **`AddGradeCommand.execute(AppState appState, HashMap<String, String> arguments)`**: Adds a grade to a student by performing the following steps:
  1. Retrieves and validates the matric number, component description, and score from `arguments`.
  2. Checks that the specified component and student exist.
  3. Ensures the score is within the allowable range for the specified component.
  4. Creates a new `Grade` object and adds it to the `GradeList` in `AppState`.

The sequence diagram of the AddGradeCommand is shown below.

![AddGradeCommand.png](diagrams/AddGradeCommand.png)

- **`DeleteGradeCommand.execute(AppState appState, HashMap<String, String> arguments)`**: Removes a grade from a student by performing these steps:
  1. Retrieves and validates the matric number and component description from `arguments`.
  2. Confirms the existence of the specified component and student.
  3. Locates and deletes the `Grade` object from the `GradeList` in `AppState`.

    
The sequence diagram of the DeleteGradeCommand is shown below.

![DeleteGradeCommand.png](diagrams/DeleteGradeCommand.png)

### Storage Load feature

#### Implementation Details

The `StudentStorage`, `GradeStorage` and `ComponentStorage` classes implement the feature to load data from the 
data `.txt` files into their respective List objects at the start of the program.

The load list methods for the Storage classes have largely similar logic flows. To avoid repetition, 
only the implementation for `GradeStorage` is shown.

The following section and sequence diagram elaborate on the implementation of the `loadGradeList` method in `GradeStorage`,
as referenced in [Setup](#setup):

![GradeStorage.png](diagrams/GradeStorage.png)

1. TutorLink constructs a new `GradeStorage`.
2. `GradeStorage` creates a new `ArrayList` of `String`s for discarded entries.
3. TutorLink calls `loadGradeList`.
4. `GradeStorage` creates a new `ArrayList` of `Grade`s.
5. While there are next lines in the data file:
   - FileScanner returns the current file line as a String and moves to the next file line.
   - `GradeStorage` calls its `getGradeFromFileLine` method with the file line.
   - If the file line references a valid `Component` and a valid `Student`, a `Grade` is returned and added to the `ArrayList`.
   - If not (e.g. file line was corrupted), the file line is added to `discardedEntries`,
   and the loop continues to the next iteration.
6. The `ArrayList` of `Grade`s is returned to TutorLink.
7. TutorLink calls `getDiscardedEntries`, and the discarded entries are displayed by UI.

## Appendix A: Product Scope

### Target User Profile

The target users for **TutorLink** are professors at NUS who manage small, single-staffed classes. These professors
typically have strong technical expertise but are often overwhelmed by time-consuming administrative tasks that detract
from their ability to focus on teaching and curriculum development.

#### Key Characteristics:

- **Time-Constrained**: Professors have limited time for lesson preparation due to the administrative burden of managing
  grades, assignments, and attendance.
- **Technologically Savvy**: While proficient in using educational platforms, they often find existing tools slow,
  overly complex, or requiring constant internet connectivity.
- **Desire for Simplicity**: They prefer tools that are easy to use, automate repetitive tasks, and function offline,
  allowing them to streamline administrative work without unnecessary complexity.

The target user values efficiency, reliability, and simplicity, seeking a solution that reduces administrative workload
and enables them to focus more on the core aspects of teaching.

### Value Proposition

**TutorLink** solves the problem of administrative overload by automating routine tasks such as managing assignments,
and monitoring student performance. Professors often struggle with time-consuming admin work that takes away from their
primary focus: teaching and preparing lessons.

By offering an offline, lightweight solution that simplifies these processes, TutorLink helps professors:

- Save time by automating tedious administrative tasks.
- Access important information quickly, without needing an internet connection.
- Focus on teaching and lesson development instead of being bogged down by admin work.

In contrast to bloated systems, TutorLink is designed to be fast, simple, and effective—freeing up valuable time and
enhancing teaching efficiency.
